# UFO filter page
This repository shows how I've used javascript, css, html to build a dynamic webpage that allows user to view and interact with the webpage.  The webpage demonstrates a mock portal that presents a large amount of eyewitness accounts of UFO data in a table.  The webpage includes a filtering function which allow users to filter through the eyewitness with specific criteria.  Once the filter is submitted, javascript process the filter and return the filtered result.  A limitation exists in the filtering function, as the existing code expects a complete match.  Some additional features that may be further developed are listed here:
  - Allow users to filter for keywords within "comments"
  - Aid user typos in search criteria, suggest closest match of term when input does not match
  - Allow export of filtered data
  - Allow sorting on display columns
