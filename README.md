# UFO Eyewitness report filter page
This repository shows how I've used javascript, css, and HTML with boostrap and d3.js libraries to build an interactive webpage.  The webpage allow users to view and interact with the webpage in real time.  The page is a mock portal that shows a large amount of eyewitness reports of UFO sighting data via a javascript data file presented in the website as a table.  I've included a filtering function that allow users to filter the table specific criteria and return the result in real time.  

The website essentially consists of 3 major components
  - **HTML** code that present the webpage
  - **Javascript** code that handles data, interaction, and backend functions
  - **CSS** for detailed, easy and consistent styling

Some enhancement ideas are listed below to further extend usability of this demo
  - Add filtering for "Duration" and "Comments"
  - Build global search function that searches keywords against all columns
  - Aid user typos in search criteria, suggest closest match of term when input does not match
  - Allow export of filtered data
  - Allow sorting on display columns
